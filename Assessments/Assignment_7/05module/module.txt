Python Modules

1. Introduction to Modules & Importing

    A module is a file that contains Python code (functions, variables, classes).
    Modules help organize code and promote reuse.
    Modules are imported using the import keyword or from … import.

2. Standard Library Modules

    math: Provides mathematical functions like square root, power, trigonometry, etc.
    random: Used to generate random numbers, choices, or shuffling data.
    These modules are built-in, so no installation is required.

3. Creating Custom Modules

    A custom module is created by saving Python code in a .py file.
    Functions or variables defined in this file can be imported into another program.
    Custom modules help manage large programs by splitting code into smaller files.

Modules make Python programs clean, organized, and reusable.
