Dictionaries

1. Introduction to Dictionaries (Key–Value Pairs)

    A dictionary stores data in key–value pairs.
    Each key is unique and used to access its value.
    Dictionaries are written using curly braces {}.

2. Accessing, Adding, Updating, and Deleting Elements

    Accessing: Values are accessed using their keys.
    Adding: A new key–value pair can be added by assigning a value to a new key.
    Updating: Existing values can be changed using their keys.
    Deleting: Elements can be removed using keywords or methods.
    Dictionaries are mutable, so changes are allowed.

3. Common Dictionary Methods

    keys(): Returns all the keys in the dictionary.
    values(): Returns all the values in the dictionary.
    items(): Returns all key–value pairs as tuples.

Dictionaries are useful for storing and managing data with meaningful labels (keys).


Dictionary Operations

1. Iterating Over a Dictionary

    You can loop through a dictionary to access keys, values, or key–value pairs.
    Commonly done using for loops.
    Iteration helps in processing or displaying dictionary data.

2. Merging Two Lists into a Dictionary

    Two lists (one for keys, one for values) can be combined into a dictionary.
    This can be done using:
    Loops: manually assign each key with its value.
    zip(): pairs elements from both lists and converts them into key–value pairs.
    Useful when data is stored separately.

3. Counting Character Occurrences in a String

    A dictionary can be used to count how many times each character appears.
    Characters act as keys, and their counts act as values.
    This is a common use case for dictionaries in text processing.

Dictionaries make counting, mapping, and data organization simple and efficient.
