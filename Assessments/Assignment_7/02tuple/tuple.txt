1. Introduction to Tuples & Immutability

    A tuple is an ordered collection of elements.
    Tuples are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation.
    They are written using parentheses ().

2. Creating and Accessing Elements

    Tuples can store different data types.
    Elements are accessed using indexing (positive and negative), similar to lists.
    Indexing starts from 0.

3. Basic Operations with Tuples

    Concatenation (+): Combines two or more tuples into one.
    Repetition (*): Repeats the tuple elements multiple times.
    Membership (in, not in): Checks whether an element exists in a tuple.

Tuples are useful when data should not be modified and needs to remain constant.


4. Positive and Negative Indexing

    Tuple elements are accessed using an index.
    Positive indexing starts from 0 (left to right).
    Negative indexing starts from -1 (right to left).
    Indexing works the same as in lists.

5. Slicing a Tuple

    Slicing is used to access a range of elements from a tuple.
    Format: tuple[start : end]
    The start index is included, the end index is excluded.
    Slicing does not change the original tuple (tuples are immutable).
