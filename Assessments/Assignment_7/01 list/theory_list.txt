*Understanding how to create and access elements in a list.
Ans
    A list is created using square brackets [].

    Example:

    numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40]

*Indexing in lists (positive and negative indexing).
Ans
    In Python, indexing is used to access elements of a list by their position. List indexing starts from 0.

*Slicing a list: accessing a range of elements.
Ans
    In Python, slicing is used to get multiple elements from a list at once.

* Common list operations: concatenation, repetition, membership.
Ans
    Concatenation (+)
    Used to join two or more lists into one list.

    Repetition (*)
    Used to repeat elements of a list multiple times.

    Membership (in / not in)
    Used to check whether an element exists in a list.

    Combined Example
    a = [1, 2]
    b = [3, 4]

    c = a + b        # concatenation
    d = a * 2        # repetition

    print(c)         # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    print(d)         # [1, 2, 1, 2]

    print(3 in c)    # True
    print(5 in c)    # False

* Understanding list methods like append(), insert(), remove(), pop().
Ans
    Understanding Common List Methods :

    (append(), insert(), remove(), pop())
        These methods are used to modify a list.
    
    append()
        Adds one element at the end of the list.
        Syntax:
            list.append(value)
    insert()
        Adds an element at a specific index.
        Syntax:
            list.insert(index, value)
    remove()
        Removes the first occurrence of a specified value.
        Syntax:
            list.remove(value)
    pop()
        Removes and returns an element.
        Syntax:
            list.pop()        # removes last element
            list.pop(index)   # removes element at index


Iterating over a List using Loops

    Iterating means accessing each element one by one.
    for loop is commonly used
    Can iterate by value or by index

2️⃣ Sorting and Reversing a List

    sort() → Sorts the list in place (original list changes)
    sorted() → Returns a new sorted list (original unchanged)
    reverse() → Reverses the list order in place

3️⃣ Basic List Manipulations

    Addition → Adding new elements using methods like append or insert
    Deletion → Removing elements using remove, pop, or del
    Updating → Changing an element using its index
    Slicing → Accessing a range of elements using start and end indexes
