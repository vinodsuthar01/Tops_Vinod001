Functions in Python

1. Defining Functions

    A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task.
    Functions are defined using the def keyword.
    Functions help reduce code repetition and improve readability.

    With parameters & with return value:

3. Anonymous (Lambda) Functions

    Lambda functions are small, unnamed functions.
    Defined using the lambda keyword.
    Usually written in a single line.
    Used for short, simple operations.

Functions make programs modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.
